The provided R scripts correspond to the code for the simulation study in the article: "Identifying rapid changes of the hemodynamic response in event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging".
The file "simulation_studies.R" contains the code for the generation and analysis of the simulated data, as well as the code used to generate the graphics.
The file "functions_base.R" contains the functions that are (implicitly or explicitly) called in "simulation_studies.R"
The file "Hierarchical_testing.R" contain an adaptation of the get_TreeBH_selection-function of the TreeBH package, available at https://github.com/cbpeterson/TreeBH.
